Quick start
-----------

.. code:: python

    from py_near.account import Account
    from py_near.dapps.fts import FTS
    import asyncio

    ACCOUNT_ID = "bob.near"
    PRIVATE_KEY = "ed25519:..."


    async def main():
        acc = Account(ACCOUNT_ID, PRIVATE_KEY)
        await acc.startup()
        transaction = await acc.staking.stake(10000)
        print(tr.transaction.hash)

        transaction = await acc.staking.receive_dividends()
        print(tr.logs)

        transaction = await acc.staking.unstake(10000)
        print(tr.transaction.hash)

    asyncio.run(main())

.. class:: Staking(DappClient)

   Client to `storage.herewallet.near contract`
   With this contract you can stake NEAR without blocking and receive passive income ~9% APY

    .. code:: python

        acc = Account(...)
        staking = acc.staking


.. class:: StakingData(DappClient)

    .. py:attribute:: apy_value
        :type: int

    .. py:attribute:: last_accrual_ts
        :type: int

        Last UTC timestamp of accrued recalc

        print(amount)


.. function:: get_user(account_id: str)

    Get user staking parameters

    :param account_id: account id
    :return: StakingData

        print(data.apy_value / 100)



.. function:: stake(amount: int, nowait: bool = False)

    Deposit staking for account

        print(res.transaction.hash)



.. function:: unstake(amount: int, nowait: bool = False)
